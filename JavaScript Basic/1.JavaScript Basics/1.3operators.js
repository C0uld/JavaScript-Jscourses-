//Binary operators
8 + 1
25 - 12
10 * 65
80 / 4

"Jhoan" + "Perez" // concatenate strings

//Unitary operators
!false //negation of negation = true
!true //negation of true = false

//Assignment operators
var a = 1;

//Operators to compare
3 == "3"; //Compare the values ​​and if they are the same return true

3 === "3"; //Compare and validate the types and values. Returns "false" for the types of the values

5 < 3
5 > 3
5 <= 6
5 >= 6

a && b //Validates if both variables are true so that the condition is met
a || b //Here the condition is met if either of the two variables is true

//Increment operator example
var edad = 40
edad++ //Increase the value by 1

edad += 2 //Increase the value by 2
